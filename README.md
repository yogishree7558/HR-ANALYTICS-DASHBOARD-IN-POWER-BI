# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD-IN-POWER-BI
In this project, we analyzed the overall Employee, Total Attrition and no of active employee  to provide insights to the HR Generalist. By leveraging data extraction, transformation, and loading techniques, we generated valuable insights using Power BI Desktop.

Data Source

The HR Analytics  data was provided in the form of an Excel file. The data underwent Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations to prepare it for analysis 

Steps Followed

# 1 . Understanding Problem: 
a. Defined the scope of the analysis, focusing on Active No of Employee, No of Attrition and percentage of Attrition rate.

#2 Data Gathering and Transformation:

a. Collected the attendance data from the provided Excel file.
